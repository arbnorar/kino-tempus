        With the world now aware that he is Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony
        Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from all sides to share his
        technology with the military. He is reluctant to divulge the secrets of
        his armored suit, fearing the information will fall into the wrong
        hands. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and "Rhodey" Rhodes (Don
        Cheadle) by his side, Tony must forge new alliances and confront a
        powerful new enemy.
